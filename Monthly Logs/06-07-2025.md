# 📘 June 2025 Learning Log

## 📅 2025-06-07

### ✅ What I Did

- Watched 30 min SwiftUI layout video (ZStack, VStack)
- Reviewed supervised vs. unsupervised learning
- Formation: Solved linked list traversal challenge
- Took notes + updated this log

### 📚 What I Learned

- SwiftUI relies on declarative layout
- Loss functions are key to measuring ML model error
- Linked lists are simple but require careful pointer tracking

### ⚠️ What Confused Me or Went Wrong

- Had trouble understanding how CoreML integrates into iOS
- Wrote a broken `while` loop — forgot to move the pointer
- Xcode UI layout confused me at first

### 🔁 What I’ll Do Next

- Rewatch CoreML video, break it into notes
- Build a small app to practice SwiftUI layout
- Try Formation’s reverse linked list challenge

## ðŸ“€ Swift UI : contains the components you use to build the interface of an app.

- Views and modifiers are the foundation of Swift

- A view is part of the interface of an app. Text is one example of a view.

- Views are distinct from the data they display. Text is the view, and the String inside the parentheses is the data.

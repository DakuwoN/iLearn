# 🧠 Formation Daily Coding Session Review

## ✅ What I Worked On

- Problem 1: While building a game, we need a grab bag: essentially a set with mechanism for randomly choosing an item. The sets can change over time, so we need to be able to add and remove items as well as make a random selection. Build a class to make this possible and the goal is for these operations to be as efficient as possible. The goal is for constant time insertions, removals, as well as the random selections.

Create a class that supports the following three methods:

- insert(val) adds a new item to the set. Return true if the item is added and false if the item was already there.
- remove(val) removes an item from the set. Return true if the removal is successful and false if the item was not in the set to begin with.
- getRandom() returns an item from the set. There must be even probability of any one item from the set being returned. If the set is empty when this is called, return None or undefined.

🎼 Reviewed solutions with mentor: Temiloluwa Otuyelu SWE @ Google.

## **Brief Summary:**

We worked in a group setting with maybe 7 total fellows. We used the Engineering Method on the problem. Once we came up with an approach, we took turns writing out the plan and then implementation. We finished right at the deadline, but did not have enough time to go deeper. Temu taught us a lot of useful tricks for an interview setting.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- 🧩 When the constraints are really tight and they want O(1) for all methods, it may usually mean that we need to use more than one data structure.

- 📀 We used a dictionary and a list.

---

## ❓ Still Confused About

- 😕 Trying to visualize the algorithm playing out was a challenge, I understood bits and pieces but not the entire process.

- The remove method was really tricky to understand.

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

- Re-attempt problem without looking at the solution
- Write notes or blog post about concept

## 🧘 Reflection

This session would be tough for me to solve alone, but the power of Formation and having other experienced engineers from top companies enabled me to learn a TON. Lots of collaboration and feedback from everyone, and we got it done in time! Productive and challenging!

## 💻 Our Code

```

import random

class RandomizedSet:
    def __init__(self):
        self.nums = list()
        self.dict = dict()


def insert(self,n):
    if n in self.dict:
        return False

    self.nums.append(n)
    self.dict[n] = len(nums) - 1
    return True

def remove(self,value):
    if value in self.dict:
        if value != self.nums[len(nums) - 1]:
            idx_to_remove = self.dict[value]
            prev_last_element = self.nums[len(nums) - 1]
            self.nums[idx] = prev_last_element
            self.dict[prev_last_element] = idx
            nums.pop()
        self.dict.remove(value)
        self.nums.pop()
        return True
    return False

def getRandom(self):
  final_pos = len(self.nums)-1
  return self.nums.get(random.randint(0, final_pos))

```

# 🧠 Formation Daily Coding Session Review

**📅 Date:** July 8th, 2025

**⏱️ Duration:** 1 hour

**📚 Topic Focus:** Linked Lists (Recursive)

---

## ✅ What We Worked On

- Problem 1: Given a linked list and an integer, find whether the integer exists in the list. Return a boolean.

- Problem 2: Given a linked list and an integer, return how many times the integer exists in the list.

- Problem 3: Find mean of a list of integers

- Problem 4: Replace all negative values with a 0

---

- Reviewed solutions with mentor: Kevin Khuong from Meta 🤘🏽

**Brief Summary:**  
The session focused on 4 engineers and a mentor, we worked through different problem sets using the engineering method. We had to come up with a recursive solution, we also went over time and space complexity.

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- 🥸 When and when not to use a sentinel node.

- How to replace a node value with a new value

- Space complexity tradeoff of using C++ vs Python or JavaScript. C++ can give you more efficient space in one of the particular problems we solved.

---

## ❓ Still Confused About

- 🤔 Just visually following recursive algorithms is a bit challenging for some problems.

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

- Practice visualizing recursive algorithms by writing them out

---

## 🧘 Reflection

- 🏎️ Kevin is my favorite mentor to work with at Formation. He is a math guy, and I love math as well. He has a great feel for our perspective because he was a fellow like us before he got to Meta. Kevin gives great advice, clear explanations, and the way he runs his sessions are very copasetic and engaging, we learn a lot. He does a review at the end to learn about our takeaways and how we can improve. He includes everyone, makes sure we all code, brainstorm, and use the engineering method.

## 💻 Our Code

```
class Node:
    def __init__(self, val, nxt=None):
        self.val = val
        self.next = nxt



def ifTargetExists(node, target):
    if node is None:
        return False
    if node.val == target:
        return True

    return ifTargetExists(node.next, target)

'''
Given a linked list and an integer, return how many times the integer exists in the list.

'''

def cntTargetExists(node, target, cnt = 0):
    if node is None:
        return cnt
    if node.val == target:
        cnt = cnt + 1

    return cntTargetExists(node.next, target, cnt)
# Worst case here is O(n)
# Space here is O(n) because of the call stack in Python
# In C++, or any language that supports tail recursion, this will be O(1) space.
# This is because there is no more work needed after the recursive call, we can simply return immediately after.

def cntTargetExists(node, target):
    if node is None:
        return 0

    return (1 if node.val == target else 0) + cntTargetExists(node.next, target)
# Worst case here is O(n)
# Space here is O(n) because of the call stack
# This is still O(n) space in C++



'''
Find mean of a list of integers

1 -> 2 -> 3, return 2
return sum / length

CLARIFICATIONS:
- What if the list is empty? Then we have a division by 0 problem


IDEA: Kornelia
- we need to first count the sum of elements
- we also need to count how many elems are in the list
Have a function that return a tuple, which is (sum,len)
And then the primary function uses this as a helper function


IDEA 2: Julia
- Put the sum and length value as parameters in the function


IDEA 3: Viet Hoang
- Iterative approach :)

1 - > 2 -> None

mean_helper(1)
total, count = mean_helper(2)
    total, count = (0, 0)
    total = 2, count = 1
total = 3, count = 2
return (3, 2)

'''

def mean_helper(node):
    if node is None:
        return (0, 0)

    total, count = mean_helper(node.next)
    return (node.value + total, 1 + count)


def mean(node):
    if node is None:
        return 0

    total, count = mean_helper(node)
    return total / count if count != 0 else 0



'''
Replace all negative values with a 0

IDEA MATTHEW:
Recursively move through the list
Check if each node value is less than zero
If true, reassign node.val to zero

'''


def all_positive_iterative(node):
    while node is not None:
        if node.val < 0:
            node.val = 0
        node = node.next


def all_positive(node):
    if node is not None:
        if node.val < 0:
            node.val = 0
        return all_positive(node.next)


```

# 🧠 Formation Daily Coding Session Review

**📅 Date:** July 15, 2025

**⏱️ Duration:** 1 hour

**📚 Topic Focus:** Recursion

---

## ✅ What I Worked On

Array Reduce Sum Recursively

- Given an array of length n, consolidate the sum created by recursively adding index pairs until there's only a single index.

---

🎼 Reviewed solutions with fellow: Senior Engineer @ MathWorks - Saurabh Deshpande

## **Brief Summary:**

Pair Programming Session

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- 🧩 You can use a loop on a recursive problem.

- 📀 More practice with Python loops

---

## ❓ Still Confused About

- The len() and range() function when trying to manipulate adjacent pairs.
- The difference of len(array) - 1 and len(array) - 2 while also using the range() function.

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

- Re-attempt problem without looking at the solution
- Write notes or blog post about concept
- Practice Python range and len iterations

---

## 🧘 Reflection

Saurabh made the learning really easy, he explained the concepts probably the best I've ever heard before. He was a Senior Engineer who offered to help me anytime and guided me throughout the problem. He helped me understand two different approaches, iteratively as well as recursively, and explained the tradeoffs for both.

## 💻 Our Code

```
def reduceSum(array):
    if len(array) <= 1:
        return array[0]
    if len(array) == 0:
        return 0

    tempArray = []

    for i in range(len(array) - 1):
        tempArray.append(array[i] + array[i + 1])
        print()

    return reduceSum(tempArray)

```

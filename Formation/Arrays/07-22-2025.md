# 🧠 Formation Daily Coding Session Review

**📅 Date:** July 22, 2025

**⏱️ Duration:** 1 hour

**📚 Topic Focus:** Number of Unique Elements Variations

---

## ✅ What I Worked On

- Most frequent element in array

  - Follow-up: In the case of a tie-breaker, pick the largest value.

- Least frequent element in array
  - Follow-up: In the case of a tie-breaker, pick the largest value.
- Count the number of elements with exactly 2 occurrences ([8, 9, 8, 3, 9, 4] returns 2)
- Given an array with all number appearing 2 times and one number appearing 3 times, find the number that shows up 3 times.
  - Follow-up: Use a set instead of a hashmap/dictionary
  - Follow-up: Given an array with all numbers appearing 3 times and one number appearing only twice, find the number that only shows up twice. You must use hashsets.

## **Brief Summary:**

Group coding drill

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- 🧩 I learned a very unique approach from a fellow who used lambda functions and the sort function to solve the problem.

- 📀 I have to practice hash maps

---

## ❓ Still Confused About

- Lambda functions

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

- Research the use of lambda functions

---

## 🧘 Reflection

It was a great learning environment, I was able to see the way other engineers approach and solve problems.

## 💻 Our Code

```
Matthews Code
def findFrequent(array):
    counts = {}
    result = 0

    for element in array:
        counts[element] = counts.get(element, 0) + 1

        elementFreq = counts[element]
        highestFreq = counts[result]

        if elementFreq > highestFreq:
            result = element

        if elementFreq == highestFreq:
            result = max(element, result)

    return result

```

```
function freq(arr) {
    let lookup = {};
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++) {
        if (lookup[arr[i]]) {
            lookup[arr[i]] += 1;
        } else {
            lookup[arr[i]] = 1;
        }
    }

    const reversed = Object.entries().sort((a, b) => b[1] - a[1]);
    const first = reversed[0];
    const second = reversed[1];


}

 class Solution:
     def find_frequent(self, array):
         if not array:
             return 0
         elements = {}
         for ele in array:
             elements[ele] = elements.get(ele, 0) + 1
             most_freq = sorted(elements.items(), key=lambda x:(x[1], x[0]), reverse=True)[0]
         return most_freq[0]


    def find_frequent(self, array):
        elements = {}
        most_freq = (0,0)
        for num in array:
            elements[num] = elements.get(num, 0) + 1
            count = elements[num]
            if count > most_freq[1]:
                most_freq = (num, count)
            if most_freq[1] == elements[num]:
               most_freq = (max(num, most_freq[0]), count)
        return most_freq[0]

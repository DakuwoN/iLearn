# 🧠 Formation Daily Coding Session Review

**📅 Date:** July 24, 2025

**⏱️ Duration:** 1 hour

**📚 Topic Focus:** Bubble Sort Recursive

---

## ✅ What I Worked On

- Implement Bubble Sort Recursively

---

🎼 Reviewed solutions with mentor: Adam Stoler of agile six

## **Brief Summary:**

- Coding Drill

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- 🧩 We implemented bubble sort using recursion with one for loop as well as without any for loops.

- 📀 We can increment the index in the parameters

- We used two helper functions, making the function more scalable and modular.

- Normally this approach would not be recommended.

## ❓ Still Confused About

- Nothing

## 🔄 Next Steps

- Practice more.

## 🧘 Reflection

Great session with Ronaldo and Adam, we all worked well together and got the problem solved.

## 💻 Our Code

```
def bubbleSort(array):

  def helper_outer(array, i):
    # base case
    if i >= len(array):
      return array

    helper_inner(array, 0, len(array) - 1 - i) # run through the inner loop call stack
    helper_outer(array, i+1)

  def helper_inner(array, j, limit):
    if j >= limit:
        return array
    if array[j] > array[j + 1]:
        temp = array[j]
        array[j] = array[j+1]
        array[j+1] = temp
    helper_inner(array, j+1, limit)

  helper_outer(array, 0)

  def bubbleSort(array):

  def helper_outer(array, i):
    n = len(array)
    if i >= n:
      return array

    for j in range(0, len(array) - i - 1):
      if array[j] > array[j + 1]:
        temp = array[j]
        array[j] = array[j+1]
        array[j+1] = temp

    helper_outer(array, i+1)

  helper_outer(array, 0)

```

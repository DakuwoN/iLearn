## ✅ What I Worked On

Flatten nested list sum

Given a nested array where each element may be 1) an integer or 2) an array, whose elements may be integers or other arrays, compute the sum of all the integers in the nested array.

What is the shape or pattern of this nested array structure?

As a follow-up, modify this code to multiply each list sum by its depth in the nesting. [1, 2] returns 3 since (1 + 2) is only inside one array.

However, [4, [2, 3]] returns 14 because the depth of [2, 3] is 2, so (2+3) × 2 = 10.
4 is added at the end to get 10 + 4 = 14.
While [4, [2, [3]]] returns 26 because the depth of [3] is 3 so 3 × 3 = 9.
Then the depth of [2, 9] is 2 so (2+9) × 2 = 22.
4 is added at the end to get 22 + 4 = 26.

## **Brief Summary:**

- ⇉ Pair Programming

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- 🧩 Python's built in function isinstance() helped us determine the next element in a list (where it was a list or integer).

- 📀 Learning how to sum nested list recursively and also optimizing this code to multiply.

- 🐅 We used two helper functions, making the function more scalable and modular.

## 🧘 Reflection

I really enjoyed working with Alan, we had good communication and flow. He also lives in Dallas, so there was this local connection. He knew his stuff, and we seemed about around the same level of knowledge.

💻 Our Code

```
def sumNestedList(nestedList: list[int]) -> int:
    totalSum = 0
    for element in nestedList:
        if isinstance(element, list):
            totalSum += sumNestedList(element)
        else:
            totalSum += element
    return totalSum

print(sumNestedList([1, 2, 3]) == 6)
print(sumNestedList([1, [1, 2, 3], 3]) == 10)
print(sumNestedList([1, [1, [1, [1, [1]]]]]) == 5)



def sumNestedListWithDepth(nestedList: list[int]) -> int:
    def helper(sublist, depth):
        totalSum = 0
        for element in sublist:
            if isinstance(element, list):
                totalSum += helper(element, depth + 1)
            else:
                totalSum += element
        return totalSum * depth
    return helper(nestedList, 1)

print((sumNestedListWithDepth([4, [2, 3]])))
print((sumNestedListWithDepth([4, [2, [3]]])))



```

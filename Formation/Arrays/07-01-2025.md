# 🧠 Formation Daily Coding Session Review

**📅 Date:** June 23, 2025

**⏱️ Duration:** 1 hour

**📚 Topic Focus:** Array Iteration

---

## ✅ What I Worked On

- Return the reverse of the array
- Sum two arrays, array1 forwards and array2 in reverse
- Given an array of integers, return an array of elements that match their index.

---

🎼 Reviewed solutions with mentor: Jerica Huang ML Engineer @ American Express.

## **Brief Summary:**

We broke off into our own pages, and we tried our best to code up three solutions to these problems.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- 🧩 I could have used the engineering method.

- 📀 My Python syntax is a bit rusty, and I need to practice more. (Reverse iteration)

---

## ❓ Still Confused About

- Nothing too much here.

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

- Re-attempt problem without looking at the solution
- Write notes or blog post about concept
- Practice Python iteration (reverse)

---

## 🧘 Reflection

I went backwards in this session in terms of Formation, I have completed the Array portion, however, I really enjoy reviewing and backtracking what I learned, it's important so I do not forget, this was well needed.

## 💻 Our Code

```
def reverse(arr):
    newArray = []
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        newArray.append(arr[i])
    return newArray


def sumTwo(arr1, arr2):
    if len(arr1) != len(arr2):
        return 0

    total = 0

    for i in range(len(arr1)):
            total += arr1[i]

    for j in range(len(arr2) - 1, -1, -1):

            total += arr2[j]
    return total



def matchIndex(arr3):

    matchingList = []

    for i in range(len(arr3)):
        if i == arr3[i]:
            matchingList.append(arr3[i])

    return matchingList


```

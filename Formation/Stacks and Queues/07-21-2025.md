# 🧠 Formation Daily Coding Session Review

**📅 Date:** July 21, 2025

**⏱️ Duration:** 1 hour

**📚 Topic Focus:** Converting between Stacks and Queues

---

## ✅ What I Worked On

- Problem 1: Stacks and queues are related in more ways that just being opposite from each other in their access models. Each can be used to implement the other! Let's be clear, theses are not useful and no one should actually implement these classes in this manner but this is a great exercise for building skill and understanding with limited access data structures.

In this workout, we are providing (at least in Javascript) some very basic NaiveStack and NaiveQueue classes. These are also not recommended ways of implementing these, but we'll use them here as our fundamental units. Using NaiveStack, implement a Queue class. Then do the opposite: using NaiveQueue, implement a Stack class.

**Brief Summary:**  
We had a group session of 4 and broke off into groups of 2 and 1 and 1, due to programming language preference. The group struggled as whole implementing the code but I think we all understood the concept well. It was challenging for us and I want more practice.

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- 🧩 A stack uses LIFO

- 🔁 A Queue uses FIFO

- 🛠️ These approaches are not recommended in practice, it was just a good exercise to strengthen our understanding.

- 🎼 We needed to initialize two data structures representing 'in' and 'out'.

---

## ❓ Still Confused About

- Visualization of the stack algorithm.

- The conversion of Queue to Stack

- The conversion of Stack to Queue

- NaiveStack and NaiveQueue?

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

- Dive deep into the conversion of Stack and Queues
- Understand the concepts stronger and trace the algorithm.
- Re attempt the problem.

## 🧘 Reflection

This problem was really tough for me to grasp. I could not follow the algorithm and gain a strong understanding of what is going on with the conversions. Mostly in code implementation, I think I understood most of it in plain English, but I need to dive deeper and practice. As a whole, the entire group took on this challenge and we walked away all learning more about ourselves.

## 💻 Our Code

```
Lilah Code

class NaiveQueue:
  def __init__(self):
    self.array = []

  def enqueue(self, value):
    self.array.append(value)

  def dequeue(self):
    return self.array.pop(0)

  def size(self):
    return len(self.array)


class StackWithQueues:

  #push to the end of the list
  #pop from the end of the list
  def __init__(self):
    self.inS = []
    self.outS = []

  def push(self, value):
    enqueue(self.inS, value)

  def pop(self):
    #[1,2,3,4]

    if not self.outS.size():
      while self.inS.size():
        outS.enqueue(self.inS.dequeue())

    return self.outS.dequeue()


    # node = dequeue(self.array[-1])
    # self.array = self.array[:-1]
    # self.size -= 1
    # return node





 Matthew Code

class NaiveStack:
  def __init__(self):
    self.array = []

  def push(self, value):
    self.array.append(value)

  def pop(self):
    return self.array.pop()

  def size(self):
    return len(self.array)


class QueueWithStack:

    def __init__(self):
        self.stack = []

    def enqueue(self, value):
        self.stack.append(value)


    def dequeue(self):



```

## Working Solution

```
class StackWithQueues:
  def __init__(self):
    self.inQ = NaiveQueue()
    self.outQ = NaiveQueue()

  def push(self, value):
    self.inQ.enqueue(value)

    while self.outQ.size():
      self.inQ.enqueue(self.outQ.dequeue())

    self.outQ, self.inQ = self.inQ, self.outQ

  def pop(self):
    return self.outQ.dequeue()

class QueueWithStacks:
  def __init__(self):
    self.inS = NaiveStack()
    self.outS = NaiveStack()

  def enqueue(self, value):
    self.inS.push(value)

  def dequeue(self):
    if not self.outS.size():
      while self.inS.size():
        self.outS.push(self.inS.pop())

    return self.outS.pop()
```

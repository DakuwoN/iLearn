# 🧠 Formation Daily Coding Session Review

**📅 Date:** August 05, 2025

**⏱️ Duration:** 1 hour

**📚 Topic Focus:** String Variations

## ✅ What I Worked On

- An anagram is a word formed by rearranging the letters of another word using all the original letters exactly once. For example, the words 'opts', 'post', 'pots', 'spot', 'stop', and 'tops' are all anagrams of each other.

A game developer is creating an online, competitive anagram game where friends can play against each other. The game's objective is to create as many anagrams as possible from a random string shown on the screen. Given the challenge word, 'displayedWord', and the user input, 'userWord', determine if the user inputs a valid anagram. What would your algorithm look like using built-in functions to simplify the implementation, how about without?

**Brief Summary:**  
This was a group session but only two of us showed up, so it was good to have it more private so that the mentor could focus on the two of us.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- 🧩 You can solve using two for loops
- You can solve using a dictionary
- Built in functions gives us the most concise solution.

---

## ❓ Still Confused About

- What is the bug in the brute force solution?

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

- Re-attempt problem without looking at the solution
- Find what went wrong

## 🧘 Reflection

Really good session that brought out deep thinking by trying to solve the problem with different variations. Although we were not to find the solution for all the test cases in one approach, we still learned a lot from the session.

💻 My Code

```


// Idea #2:
function isAnagram(displayedWord, userWord) {
  let displayedArray = displayedWord.split("").sort()
  let userArray = userWord.split("").sort()
  return JSON.stringify(displayedArray) === JSON.stringify(userArray)
}

// Idea #1
function isAnagram(displayedWord, userWord) {
  if (displayedWord.length !== userWord.length) {
    return false
  }

  let counts = {}

  for (let i = 0; i < displayedWord.length; i++) {
    if (counts[displayedWord[i]]) {
      counts[displayedWord[i]] = counts[displayedWord[i]] + 1;
    } else {
      counts[displayedWord[i]] = 1;
    }
  }

  for (let i = 0; i < userWord.length; i++) {
    if (counts[userWord[i]] < 0 || !counts[userWord[i]]) {
      return false
    }

    if (counts[userWord[i]]) {
      counts[userWord[i]] -= 1;
    }
  }

  return Object.keys(counts).length == displayedWord.length;
}

function isAnagram(displayedWord, userWord) {
  if (displayedWord.length !== userWord.length) {
    return false
  }

  let counter = 0;

  for (let i = 0; i < displayedWord.length; i++) {
    for (let j = 0; j < userWord.length; j++) {
      if (counter === displayedWord.length) {
        return false
      }

      if (displayedWord[i] !== userWord[j]) {
        counter++
        break;
      }
    }
  }
  }
  console.log(counter)
  return true



```

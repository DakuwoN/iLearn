# 🧠 Formation Daily Coding Session Review

**📅 Date:** June 29, 2025

**⏱️ Duration:** 1 hour

**📚 Topic Focus:** String Variations

---

## ✅ What I Worked On

- Reverse letters in words
- Rotate words by x

📀 Reviewed solutions with mentor: Luv @ Senior Engineer @ Microsoft

**Brief Summary:**  
Group session where we try to code a few problems in our own CoderPads. We got through two problems and one code solution. The second problem we were able to come up with a high level approach.

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- 🧩 You can use slicing to manipulate strings most of the time.

---

## ❓ Still Confused About

- Slicing and rotating of the array
- How does this ACTUALLY work?

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

- Re-attempt problem without looking at the solution
- Write notes or blog post about concept

---

## 🧘 Reflection

This group session was very helpful, I gained a stronger understanding of the time and space complexity, as well as the brute force solution using nested for loops.

💻 My Code

```
def reverseLetters(word):
    words = word.split()

    reversed = [letter[::-1] for letter in words]
    result = " ".join(reversed)
    return result
print(reverseLetters('matthew'))
print(reverseLetters('Reverse the words in this string'))
# esreveR eht sdrow ni siht gnirts


def rotateWords(sentence):
    words = sentence.split()

```

# 🧠 Formation Daily Coding Session Review

**📅 Date:** July 2, 2025

**⏱️ Duration:** 1 hour

**📚 Topic Focus:** Ranged Strings

---

## ✅ What I Worked On

- Given a sorted array of integers, convert this to a string that represents these numbers as ranges. A range is a series of consecutive numbers and is represented in the output as the first number followed by a dash, followed by the last number.

---

- Reviewed solutions with mentor: Oluwapelumi Sola-Aremu (Senior SWE) from Dublin, Ireland.

---

**Brief Summary:**  
This session came down to just myself and another fellow. I understood the problem expectations, but had a hard time wrapping my head around visualizing the algorithm.

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- 🧩 I learned how to check if an array of integers are counting, and how to determine if it's skipping a number in numerical order.

- 🔁 The problem required knowledge of string operations such as template literal and migrating an array into a string while adding a dash "-" in between.

- 🛠️ We handled spaces as delimiter, to flush the stack. Flushing the stack means popping all the characters out of the stack and into the result string (reserves the word). Then add the space itself to preserve word order.

---

## ❓ Still Confused About

- Visualizing the algorithm
- The three variables used and how we manipulate them (start, end, prev)

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

- Re-attempt problem without looking at the solution
- Write notes or blog post about concept
- Practice string operations

---

## 🧘 Reflection

The problem was a bit more difficult for me, however, I had some takeaways from the session and learned a lot.

## 💻 My Code

```
def rangedString(arr):
    result = []
    if arr == 0:
        return result

    start = end = prev = arr[0]

    for i in (range(1, len((arr)))):
        if arr[i] == prev + 1:
            end = arr[i]
        else:
            if start == end:
                result.append(str(start))
            else:
                result.append(f"{start}-{end}")
            start = end = arr[i]
        prev = arr[i]

    if start == end:
        result.append(start)
    else:
        result.append(f"{start}-{end}")
    return ','.join(result)


print(rangedString([1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 9, 10]))
```

# 🧠 Formation Daily Coding Session Review

**📅 Date:** June 11, 2025

**⏱️ Duration:** 1 hour

**📚 Topic Focus:** String Variations

---

## ✅ What I Worked On

- Problem 1: Reverse letters in word: In this variation, keep the order of the words the same, but reverse the letters within each word.

- Problem 2: Rotate words by X

- Reviewed solutions with mentor/peer: Oluwapelumi Sola-Aremu (Senior SWE) from Dublin, Ireland.

**Brief Summary:**  
Today I worked with a fellow named Gourav, he was a more experienced and skilled engineer than myself, so it was a great opportunity to learn. Our live coding session was held on Google meets as usual, and the session was string variations, we managed to get through two problems. These sessions are designed so we work on variations of a problem type. We try and work through as many problems as possible within the 1 hour time frame.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- 🧩 We used a stack to reverse the words, LIFO (Last In First Out), stacks are ideal to reverse
- 🔁 We did not use built in methods. Instead of using split, we read each character one by one, which gives us more control over what's happening.
- 🛠️ We handled spaces as delimiter, to flush the stack. Flushing the stack means popping all the characters out of the stack and into the result string (reserves the word). Then add the space itself to preserve word order.

- 🎼 We use math to compute the solution along with slicing, splitting and joining. (Rotate words by k)

## ❓ Still Confused About

- The delimiter and spacing
- Visualization of the algorithm
- Slicing strings

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

- Re-attempt problem without looking at the solution
- Write notes or blog post about concept

---

## 🧘 Reflection

The stack approach was a new perspective for me.  
I understood what the algorithm was trying to do, but I do not have a complete visualization of the algorithm in action. The delimiter and spacing I feel is probably a bit cloudy in my mind.

\*\* 💻 My Code

```
def reverseString(sentence):
    reversedSolution = ""
    stack = []

    for character in sentence:

        if character == " ":
            while stack:
                reversedSolution += stack.pop()
            reversedSolution += ' '
        else:
            stack.append(character)

    while stack:
        reversedSolution += stack.pop()


    return reversedSolution

```

```
def rotateString(sentence, k):
    words = sentence.split(" ")
    len_of_words = len(words)
    pivot = k % len_of_words

    if pivot == 0:
        return sentence
    return ' '.join(words[len_of_words - pivot:]) + ' ' + ' '.join(words[0: len_of_words - pivot])

print(rotateString('Hello world', 1))
```

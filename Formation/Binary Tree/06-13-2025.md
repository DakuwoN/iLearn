# 🧠 Formation Daily Coding Session Review

**📅 Date:** June 13, 2025

**⏱️ Duration:** 30 mins

**📚 Topic Focus:** Binary Tree (Core Algo)

---

## ✅ What I Worked On

- Problem 1: Pair Learning Count Elements in a Binary Tree (recursive)

- Reviewed solutions with mentor/peer: Eric Lynch from Boston, MA

**Brief Summary:**  
Pair programming session with fellow Eric Lynch, we tackled the problem together as I became the Navigator and Eric was the driver. This is one of our core algorithms at Formation, meaning we should be able to code this solution under their time constraint, which I believe for this is like 2 minutes.

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- 🥸 We used the engineering method, we thought of some good questions to ask in interviews, we brainstormed the problem, wrote test cases, wrote out our plan in pseudo code, then we implemented together, I did a line and then Eric did a line. We also discuss time and space complexity.

## ❓ Still Confused About

- 🤔 What are some good questions to ask on problems like this one--that are very subtle in code and thought.

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

- Re-attempt problem without looking at the solution
- Write notes or blog post about concept

---

## 🧘 Reflection

- 🏎️ This was good practice and review, as this is one of our core algorithms that Formation expects us to master and we are drilled with. I can improve on my engineering method, it's tough because the problem is very straight forward.

## 💻 Our Code

```
class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, value = 0, left = None, right = None):
        self.value = value
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def count_tree(root):

  if not root:
    return 0

  return 1 + count_tree(root.left) + count_tree(root.right)

```

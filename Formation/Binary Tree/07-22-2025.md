# 🧠 Formation Daily Coding Session Review

**📅 Date:** June 22, 2025

**⏱️ Duration:** 1 hour

**📚 Topic Focus:** Intro to Binary Trees

---

## ✅ What I Worked On

- Find Nodes Repeated K times in Binary Tree
- Number of Nodes Less than K in Binary Tree

- Reviewed solutions with mentor: Luv from Microsoft

**Brief Summary:**  
Group session where fellows break off into groups and code up problems in their own page.

---

## 💡 Key Takeaways

- 🥸 I could have use a queue to iterate through the tree.
- We can use a queue with a dictionary.
- My solutions logic was good, but the code would not run. We could not figure out why.

---

## ❓ Still Confused About

- 🤔 Why my code did not run if the logic was fine.

---

## 🔄 Next Steps

- Practice more of these problem types.

---

## 🧘 Reflection

- 🏎️ It was a good session, Luv is a good teacher but the other fellows seemed shy and quiet, they all had their cameras off and spoke very little. I wish they were more engaged, because they had lots of experience, instead I spoke up and tried to engage.

## 💻 Our Code

```

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = 0
        self.left = left
        self.right = right

def mostFreq(node, k):
    if node is None:
        return -1

    counts = {}
    queue = deque[(node)]

    while queue:
        poppedNode = queue.popleft()

        if poppedNode.val in counts:
            counts[poppedNode.val] += 1
        else:
            counts[poppedNode.val] = 1

        if poppedNode.left:
            queue.append(poppedNode.left)
        if node.right:
            queue.append(poppedNode.right)

    for key, value in counts.items():
        if value == k:
            return value

This would not run

def lessThankK(root, k):
    if root is None:
        return 0
    count = 0
    if root.val < k:
        count = 1
    return count + lessThankK(root.left, k) + lessThankK(root.right, k)

tree = TreeNode(1, TreeNode(2, TreeNode(3), TreeNode(4, TreeNode(4, TreeNode(6, TreeNode(6))))))

print(lessThankK(tree, 2))



```
